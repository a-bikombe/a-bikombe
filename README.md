# Welcome to my corner of the internet!

My name is Arianna Bikombe, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I'm a Computer Information Systems Major in my junior year at UNH Manchester.

My current main project is my personal website, [aribikombe.com](https://aribikombe.com/). It's my most long-project as of now, since I've been working on it since 2017. It's still under construction, but feel free to check out what I have so far!
