# Welcome to my corner of the internet!

My name is Arianna Bikombe, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I'm a Computer Information Systems Major in my senior year at UNH Manchester.

My current main project is my personal website, Riri's Palace. It's my most long-project as of now, since I've been working on it since 2017.
